#FusionAdoptabot
----
  
This is an adaptation of Printrbot's adoptabot original design.   
This adaptation, removes printerbot's proprietary parts.  
* Hotend is replaced with E3D V6 All metal hotend  
* Extruder is an E3D Titan  
* The bed sensor is a BLtouch  
* Electronics are Arduino Mega + Ramps 1.4-1.6  
  
PLA Parts all printed with 3 or 4 Permitars and 33% infill.  
Suports are not included as these will vary with your own printerbot.  
  
The only custom component is the Print bed.  
  
All credit goes to Brook for releasing this design into the community. Without his work this would not have been possible.  
  
**This design is licensed cc sharealike non comercial.**  
  
###3D Models:  
The 3D design is included  as a Fusion F3Z. Download this Fusion Archive. Launch Fusion 360. Create a new Project and in the data pane click upload. Select the F3Z.
Fusion will unpack the archive and upload all the necissary parts and assemblies into the new project.  
  
The model is also provided as STEP203 and can be imported into most any 3D CAD tool.
  
###STL Files:  
Over the comming weeks I will extract and post the STL files. You can get these yourself from the above 3D models.    
Posting of the STL files is only a convience for those looking to simply print and assemly the printer.  
  
###Firmware:
A work in progress firmware is available here:
